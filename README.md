Linear Regression was done on time series to accomodate seasonality and trens.

A hybrid boosted model was also made using linear regression and XGBoost()

Simple linear regression  model was slightly more accurate. This was not shocking as XGBoost only contained single feature column 
(for the purpose of practicing this technique) to avoid large fitting times.

Best achieved score was 0.5109.
